This is a skeleton for CS 111 Lab 1.

Replace this README file with notes on your implementation.
Mentions any special features or limitations.

Make-command-stream now can print out the command stream successfully (I hope so, need more teast cases)
Each "command" (word or special character) is store one command_stream struct and link to the next command by a pointer.For example:
	sort -k2 d - < a | uniq -c > e
	Become: 
			- struct 1: head = sort
									next = struct 2
			- struct 2: head = -k2
									next = struct 3
			- struct 3: head = d...
	Note that special character like < the its struct's head = <
Make-command-stream read the stream and ignore all the white space, new line, comment (need tested)

What to do next:
	Read each command token, build a command tree and save each command into command struct with its type
