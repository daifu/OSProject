Lab1a: 
	The command-stream is built as a tree-like structure, for example: a || b | c is
											||
										/		 \
									a				|
												/		\
												b		c

	Then the command is read from the top level, which is and-or command. It include a lot of error checking, sometimes
	redundant but necessary to make sure that the syntax passed is correct
	- Limitation: since we don't have a reliable test cases for sequence and subshell command (the test-ok do not provide
		us test cases for these 2 type of command), we have to test it with our own knowledge and not sure if it cover all
		possible cases

Lab1b:
	No known limitation, all of the text cases run good
